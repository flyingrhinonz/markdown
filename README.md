Yet another markdown cheat sheet.
This one separates the basic markdown (supported everywhere)
from the advanced markdown (which is supported to varying levels by different programs).
I'm not including markdown features that are site-specific with the goal that this
page only covers what you'd expect to find everywhere (almost).

Note - github supports advanced markdown as well as adding some of its own specialties.
Therefore some items here may appear better (or different) to what you'd see with
viewers that are more traditional.

Probably easiest to download the source file and look at how it's written or view
the source and rendered versions in github side by side in two browsers.
